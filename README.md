# Slang

Command line tool to help keep up with the hipsters.

## Installation

If you already have the Go compiler installed.
```sh
go install github.com/timwmillard/slang
```

If you don't have Go, you might not be cool enough to use `slang`. But you can always try.  Install [Go](https://go.dev/) first.

### API Key

You will need to get an API key.  Sign up to [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/community/api/urban-dictionary), to get a free API key.

Then run the auth option and enter your API key at the prompt.
```sh
slang -auth
```

## Usage

```sh
slang <word-you-dont-know-what-it-means>
```
